# RAM Hacks Coding Challenge!

Hi! Welcome to RAM Hack's first weekly coding challenge. Here, we (and anyone else) can post little challenges to keep the brain working. Then, we can review some of the submitted work to compare, contrast, and discuss the solutions. Hopefully it'll create interesting conversation and spark some interesting discussion. The problems should be simple enough to be accessible but hard enough to be entertaining. We strongly encourage everyone take a shot at them. Use whatever language you want, even psuedocode if you'd like! Just commit your work or share it at the next meeting. The more people that contribute, the more interesting this will be.


### Rules:
There are no rules. Use any language, any format, contribute what you can. This is a for-fun exercise! We only ask that you please don't copy-paste solutions from online and claim them as your own. We want to be able to pick your brain on your solution.

### How to play:
Click the latest challenge below. The problems will be posted here, to the Github repo. Simply read the problem, download any associated files, and code away. When you're done, commit the file to the "solutions" directory. Don't forget to include your name! Submit anything you've got, working or not. Participation is key here!

Then, come to RAM Hacks on Tuesdays in the Graduate Lounge in Tyler Hall. We'll review the solutions that were submitted and discuss the problems. Even if you don't submit a solution, come anyways! Eat pizza, discuss computery things, and just hang out.


Code golf is _always_ encouraged, though. ;) Maybe we can have a golf competition.
